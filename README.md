# systolic array for matrix multiplication

simple systolic array made for 4x4 matrix multiplication
made in verilog using IcarusVerilog. with simple gui.

guide:
```
run "python main.py"


write matrices in 'matrix1' and 'matrix2' like this:
  1 2 3 4
  1 2 3 4
  1 2 3 4
  1 2 3 4
where there is 'space' between each number.
```



## notes:
last matrix result is the answer - (runs more time than needed i know...you can change the runtime in main.py where $finish 
   change #500 to desired time)
